# Personal Diary Application (C++ OOP Microproject)

## Project Overview
A **console-based personal diary application** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++**.  
This project allows users to **securely create accounts, log in, and manage diary entries** with functionalities like adding, viewing, editing, and deleting entries. Each entry is timestamped with the current date and time for better organization.

## Features
  **User Authentication**

  - Login with password validation.

  **Diary Management**
  - Add new diary entries with automatic timestamping.
  - View all past entries in a structured format.
  - Edit entries by specifying the exact date and time.
  - Delete specific entries based on timestamp.

  **File Handling**
  - User credentials stored securely in separate files.
  - Each userâ€™s diary entries saved in a dedicated text file.

  **OOP Concepts**
  - **Inheritance:** `Diary` class derived from `User`.
  - **Encapsulation:** Password handling and validation.
  - **Abstraction:** User operations through well-defined methods.
